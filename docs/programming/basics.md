# Basics of Programming

## What is compilation?
A special program called a compiler converts your source code into a different format that the computer's central processing unit (CPU) can execute.

Although most programming languages seem cryptic at first, they can be more easily understood by humans than the computer's preferred language. The CPU understands instructions that are expressed by turning thousands or millions of tiny switches either on or off. Compilers bridge these two worlds by translating your human-readable instructions into a computer-understandable set of instructions.

## What is syntax ?
The rules for writing a code is called syntax. Just like human languages have rules regarding punctuation and sentence structure, computer programming languages also have rules. Those rules define the keywords and operators of a programming language and how they are put together to form programs.
