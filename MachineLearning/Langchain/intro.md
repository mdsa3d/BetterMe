<h1>LangChain Framework Cheat Sheet</h1>

<h2>1. Introduction to LangChain</h2>
<p>LangChain is a framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs), offering tools for prompt engineering, memory management, and more.</p>

<h2>2. Large Language Models (LLMs)</h2>
<p>LLMs like GPT-3 are neural networks trained on vast text data, used for tasks like translation and summarization.</p>

<h2>3. Prompt Engineering</h2>
<p>Technique to adapt LLMs to specific tasks using structured text prompts.</p>

<h2>4. Word Embeddings</h2>
<p>Representing words as vectors to improve LLMs' understanding and response.</p>

<h2>5. LLM Tech Stack With LangChain</h2>
<p>LangChain simplifies tasks like creating prompt templates, interfacing with LLMs, and providing context to user inputs.</p>

<h2>6. LangChain for Java</h2>
<p>Community version LangChain4j available, supporting Java 8 or higher and Spring Boot 2 and 3.</p>

<h2>7. Building Blocks of LangChain</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Models I/O</strong>: Interface with LLMs, manage model inputs and outputs.</li>
  <li><strong>Memory</strong>: Store information about past interactions with LLMs.</li>
  <li><strong>Retrieval</strong>: Retrieve relevant external data and pass it to LLMs during generation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Complex Applications of LangChain</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Chains</strong>: Sequence multiple components in a specific order for complex applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Agents</strong>: Use LLMs as reasoning engines to determine actions in applications.</li>
</ul>
